## Site architecture
- Keep hospital services, about, updates, and contact as separate TanStack routes, with shared navigation in the root layout, so each page is directly reachable and indexable.
- Use the local hospital photos in public/images with Vite's BASE_URL so photos work on both Lovable and GitHub Pages.
